# PyChemicals 😁

This is a python package I created right after finishing CS50P, to help people with chemical calculations like pH, and plotting titration curves. Chempy exists, but it doesn't
handle these sort of issues, so that is why I decided to make my own.

Collab would be greatly appreciated.
